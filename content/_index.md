{{< header3 heading = "THE FRIENDS OF EAST COWES AND WHAT WE DO">}}


A “Friends of East Cowes Cemetery” group was suggested by Margaret Lloyd and set
up as a community organisation in 2006, shortening its name to “Friends of East
Cowes” the following year, on completion of the lottery-funded Old Kingston
Cemetery project (see Brief History below).

All of us live in East Cowes and we all care about the Town: we want to make it an
even better place in which to live....and we don't just talk, we are ready to roll up our
sleeves and carry out small projects to improve the quality of life for everyone. We've
planted trees, picked up litter and gone for walks, looking at the town with fresh eyes
to see what other practical improvements we can make. We can't tackle larger works,
that's for the Town and County councils and perhaps town centre developers, but we
apply for small grants to cover the cost of material and equipment for our projects.
We meet up on the morning of the first Sunday of each month at Kingston Cemetery
to carry out “tidy-ups”.

##### A BRIEF HISTORY OF KINGSTON CEMETERY

Before St. James' Church was consecrated in 1833 East Cowes people were buried
in Whippingham churchyard. As St. James' churchyard too began to reach capacity a
burial board was set up (in 1873) to search out another suitable site. In August 1876
Queen Victoria gave 3.5 acres of Kingston Farm land to be used as a public
cemetery. This was ready for consecration by late 1876, and the first burial was that
of Maria Amberstone Chiverton, aged 52, who was interred on 10th January 1877.
Interments in the extension across Kingston Road began in 1954,and most burials
now take place there.

THE CEMETERY PROJECT:

The Friends of East Cowes Cemetery was set up as a community organisation in
2006, after a substantial bid to the Big Lottery's Local Heritage Initiative fund carried
out through the East Cowes Community Partnership's Environmental group was
successful.
The stated aims were:
to make improvements to this largely disused and neglected cemetery; research the
history of some of those interred there; catalogue all the burial plots and produce
information material from our research. The original website was set up to publicise
the project and as a integral tool to promote and research the history of the cemetery,
of East Cowes, and of its people. (See separate entry in “Projects” fro more details of
the database).

For environmental improvements we created welcoming shrub/flower beds near the
cemetery gates (which we also cleaned of rust and re-painted); purchased three
benches for the central circle and erected three information panels. Peter Lloyd repaved
the old 'mortuary' area and we repaired the bench thereon. Countryside
Rangers helped in putting up bird and bat boxes and local schoolchildren plantefd
bulbs along the central avenue. Angie Mathews helped to scrub down the dingylooking
Air Raid memorial.The bronze panel on a wooden post near the gates bears
an inscription provided by Glyn Roberts.

Ken Wheeler created an interesting booklet about some of the people buried in the
cemetery and some of its flora and fauna.
We hope to include photos of memorials and further information gleaned by Janet
Griffin from the Records Office. Ken Wheeler is now also adding to the photographic
records.
