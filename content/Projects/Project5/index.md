{{< header3 heading = "East Cowes Walks" >}}


Friend and East Coweser Peter Lloyd knew that his town had a lot of unadvertised
history, and initially came up with a walking route around the “triangle” of roads
constructed in the 1840's to enclose the planned East Cowes Botanic Gardens.
Those roads (York Avenue, Adelaide Grove and Victoria Grove) still bear the look of
planned rather than haphazard development.

From Peter's idea came plans for a series of heritage walks around the town.
Realising that there was an Island-wide “Health Walks” scheme co-ordinated by the
IOW NHS, we devised a project which combined both aspects: Health and
Heritage. Big Lottery funding was offered for the project and the IW NHS helped by
printing leaflets covering the three walks, with hand-drawn maps and further
information about the Friends. We were also able to design and purchase four
bronze plaques to be erected to commemorate some of the notable East Cowes
residents and events. Only one plaque, referring to Bell's Landing on the
Esplanade, is yet to be erected because of planning issues in the area.
