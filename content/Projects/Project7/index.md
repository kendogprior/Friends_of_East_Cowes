{{< header3 heading = "The Book of East Cowes" >}}

Apart from Rosetta Brading's two books chronicling events in the town from 1303
there had not been a comprehensive volume telling the story of East Cowes from
all its various aspects. It seems that more than one person had been thinking along
these lines, because when in 2008 Margaret Prior suggested to the Friends that
this might be a project that they could undertake, Sarah Burdett (also of the
Heritage Centre and Isle of Wight Society) suggested that she and Margaret work
together to put together a book using the wealth of archived material amassed at
the Centre. Ken Wheeler used his experience in publishing to help with the text
styles and layout.


And so it was that, in 2011,the book, entitled “EAST COWES, A TOWN OF SHIPS,
CASTLES, INDUSTRY AND INVENTION” was launched. It has sold well and is still
available to buy at the Heritage Centre.
