{{< header3 heading = "Speeding Fine Sculpture" >}}

In 1899 Henry House, an inventor from the USA who had established the Liquid
Fuel Comany in East Cowes, was caught 'speeding' down York Avenue in his
innovative vehicle by two policemen with stopwatches, who estimated his speed as
18mph. For this he received the first speeding fine on the Island, with the judge
describing his driving as “furious”.
Friend of East Cowes and self-taught sculptor Glyn Roberts confessed to a liking
for 'quirky' subjects for his creations, and found House's story interesting enough to
create an amusing piece to be installed in the town close to where the 'event' took
place. 

Glyn's sculpture, depicting a policeman with a stopwatch and House's
vehicle, was set in a stone along with an explanatory bronze plaque (we had help
from the Town Council towards the costs and planning permission).
Glyn, David Burdett and Peter Lloyd laboured to erect the stone, at the junction of
York Avenue and New Barn Road, and on 4th June 2011 it was unveiled by
incumbent High Sheriff Susie Sheldon.


Glyn Roberts was one of the founder members of the Friends and his good humour
and enthusiasm were invaluable in setting up the organisation and obtaining
Lottery funding for the cemetery project. When he moved back to the mainland to
marry again we knew we had lost a very good friend.The speeding fine sculpture
seemed like a farewell gift to the Town and it was with great sadness that we learnt
in early 2016 that Glyn had passed away.
