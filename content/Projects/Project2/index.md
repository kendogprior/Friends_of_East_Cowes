{{< header3 heading = "St James' Church Gates" >}}


In April 2017 the Friends of East Cowes painted and repaired the gates and lamp at the entrance to St James' churchyard. Years of rust and old paint were removed and a new coat was applied. The lamp was re-glazed&nbsp;making it a fine&nbsp;welcome for visitors to the church.
