One of our earlier projects was to offer the residents of Alfred Street a wall planter
each (the street comprises of terraces of houses which are accessed directly off the
pavement). Many took up the offer and a few still use their planters for floral
displays.
We also redecorated the (then) Floating Bridge waiting room.
We gave the Shedden Fountain on the seafront a lick of paint and requested that a
lamp be renstalled on top. After several frustrating years of getting nowhere this
was finally done in 2020 (just at the beginning of the Covid pandemic).


More recently we were approached by the St. James' Churchwarden who asked if
we could re-paint the railings around John Nash's tomb (beside the church entrance
doors), and also the churchyard gates. Atop these is an arch and lamp, which was
also repaired and re-glazed, making a fitting entrance to this historic site.
A memory project “I Remember”, for local people to reminisce about living in East
Cowes, has been completed and awaits printing out. It will be kept at the Heritage
Centre for anyone to refer to.
