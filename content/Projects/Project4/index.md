{{< header3 heading = "Cemetery Tidy-Ups" >}}


Because we created the flower beds near the entrance gates, we started regular
monthly “tidy-ups”, which now include 'de-whiskering' trees along the avenues and
clearing up autumn leaves.
PLEASE NOTE that the condition of individual graves is the responsibility of the
plot owners, and the Friends are not allowed to do any work thereon except with
their permission or at their request. However, IWC Bereavement Services do
employ contractors to manage the grassed areas.
If you would like to meet the Team, come along at about 10.30am on the first
Sunday of any month (except for January!).
