{{< header4 heading = "EAST COWES HERITAGE MAP" >}}



The East Cowes Heritage Centre over the last year is collaborating with Dr Janet Owen in "Putting East Cowes on the map!" The Earth Museum takes photographs of artefacts owned or suggested by various museums and places them on a map of the area.&nbsp; Janet felt that East Cowes should be a trial place, and it has just gone live. If you could promote the link amongst your friends it would be great.
