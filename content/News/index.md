There have been two years of holding subdued, socially-distanced
commemorations at the Kingston Cemetery Air Raid Memorial, due to
the Covid pandemic. But on June 5th this year (2022) we were able to
hold the traditional Act of Remembrance to mark the 80th anniversary of
the Cowes/East Cowes Blitz. A short service was led by Father Jonathan
Redvers Harris of St. David's Church, aassisted by Rev. David Plumb of
East Cowes Methodist Church. Our Chairman Ken Wheeler read out the
names of all local people who lost their lives to Luftwaffe bombing raids
during WW2 and then Musician Karen Walker of the Medina Marching
Band played the Last Post and Reveille. Wreaths and other floral
tributes were laid at the memorial: we were pleased that a party of
Polish Naval personnel from ORP Błyskawica was present to add a
traditional Polish funerary lantern.

Among those at the service were several folks who remembered the
actual night of the Blitz, plus representatives of Ryde Fire Service, the
Royal Naval Association and the Royal British Legion. Mayor of East
Cowes Tracey Reardon and Błyskawica Society President Geoff Banks
were among the wreath-layers. The service was part of a week-long
programme of events on both sides of the Medina.

The East Cowes Heritage Centre over the last year is collaborating with Dr Janet Owen in "Putting East Cowes on the map!" The Earth Museum takes photographs of artefacts owned or suggested by various museums and places them on a map of the area.&nbsp; Janet felt that East Cowes should be a trial place, and it has just gone live. If you could promote the link amongst your friends it would be great.
